CONTENTS OF THIS REPO:

docker_notes.txt has my notes for the video, with code-examples. 
There may be misstyping, so double check the code and commands.

demo_project/ holds my recreation of Anna Smith's demo Docker/NodeJS project.
If you have errors when building, there may be version conflicts. It is possible
to strictly set version numbers for the code, but I didn't do that exactly, so good luck ;)

Read the notes and watch the video if you'd like to follow along.
